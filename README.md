Project Overview

Edu Speak is an innovative system that helps streamline classroom learning by automating the process of converting live lectures into clean, well-structured notes. Here’s how it works:Speech-to-Text:Teachers log into the system, start speaking, and the platform captures their speech. This audio is instantly converted to text using Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text API.Text Cleaning:The raw transcribed text often contains background noise, irrelevant discussions, or distractions (such as interruptions or off-topic comments). To improve the clarity of the notes, OpenAI’s API is used to filter out unnecessary content, ensuring that only relevant lecture material remains.PDF Generation:After cleaning, the text is compiled into well-formatted PDFs. These files are easily accessible to students and teachers via unique login credentials. Students can log in and download notes for each day’s lecture, making learning more efficient and organized.
